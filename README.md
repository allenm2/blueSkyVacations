      <h3>Theme Design Notes</h3>
      
      <p>
     During our meeting using WebEx Courtney, Matt and Ken met with Pamela online to listen to her requests for her business's website.  In this meeting we understood the following about her business...<br /><br />  We met with our client Pamela on 6/28/2016.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>This is a small start up business ran by Pamela in Michigan who is a licensed realtor.</li>
         <li>At this current time there is no web site for Blue Sky Vacations.</li>
         <li>Pamela would like to maintain her website as time goes on.</li>
         <li>Pamela want's to increase awareness for the business.</li>
         <li>There are 2 target audiences for this business, the renters and  the property owners.</li>
         <li>We have a domain name which is blueskyvacationofmichigan.com however we need to figure out a hosting service for her.</li>
         <li>Pamelas main concern was making the homepage most important with lots of color and animation and life to it.</li>
         <li>There is lots of competition so we need to make this site stand out for her business.</li>
         <li>We need to make the rentals appealing to renters in a tough market.</li>
      </ul>
